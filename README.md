# One Hit Reset ROM Hacks
Makes it so that any hit you take (includes instant deaths such as touching a spike or falling into a pit) resets the game.

## Supported games
Mega Man 1-6 (US) and Rockman 1-6 (JP). PAL roms are **not supported**.

## Online Patcher
For ease of use, I've created an online patcher on my website: https://nudua.com/one-hit-reset  
*You do not need to download the ips patches.

## Manual Patching
Use your favorite IPS patcher, such as [Lunar IPS (Windows)](http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/) or [MultiPatch (MacOSX)](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/746/)
